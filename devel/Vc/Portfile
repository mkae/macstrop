description         Portable, zero-overhead SIMD library for C++
long_description \
                    Vc is a free software library to ease explicit vectorisation of \
                    C++ code. It has an intuitive API and provides portability \
                    between different compilers and compiler versions as well as \
                    portability between different vector instruction sets. Thus an \
                    application written with Vc can be compiled for AVX\; SSE2 up to SSE4.2\; \
                    SSE4a\; XOP\; FMA4 and FMA or Scalar (fallback which works everywhere).\n\
                    This port should ideally be installed from source (built locally).
