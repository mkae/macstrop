description         KDE music education.
long_description    Minuet aims at supporting students and teachers in many \
                    aspects of music education, such as ear training, first-sight \
                    reading, solf√®ge, scales, rhythm, harmony, and improvisation. \
                    Minuet makes extensive use of MIDI capabilities to provide a \
                    full-fledged set of features regarding volume, tempo, and pitch \
                    changes, which makes it a valuable tool for both novice and \
                    experienced musicians. Minuet features a rich set of ear training \
                    exercises and new ones can be added seamlessly in order to extend \
                    its functionalities and adapt it to several music education contexts.
